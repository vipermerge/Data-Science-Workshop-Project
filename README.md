# Data-Science-Workshop-Project
This is where my data science workshop project proposal resides

Here are three ideas for data projects that I find interesting...

1) Predicting restaurant preferences:
Problem: Social media restaurant reviews generally use a five star system. However, these stars do not reflect the specific preferences of any individual user, leaving travelers to sift the recommendations of strangers whose tastes vary greatly. 
I propose gathering data from social media on restaurant reviews to develop a predictive model tailored to the individual based on 1) the individual's indicated ratings and 2) ratings of others whose tastes are similar to the individual seeking a recommendation. Not sure where I would find this data or access it.

2) Customer lifetime value:
Problem: Our local area has seen increased competition among credit unions. I propose estimating the lifetime value of different customer segments to improve targeting and offerings for a credit union client. I would use the client's actual customer database for this project.

3) POS data analysis:
Problem: A local grocery chain has recently launched a customer loyalty program. They have thousands of members but no capability to use the data they are collecting. I would like to help them analyze the data and make predictions about specific offers to increase lifetime value of the most attractive customers. The client would provide the data set in an unwrangled form.

4) Survey data analysis:
Problem: An online retailer conducts exit surveys on an ongoing basis. They do not use the data but are interested in increasing customer profitability and matching specific offers to customers based on observed behavior. I would build a segmentation and predictive model to increase response rate for specific offers and customers. The data would come from the client survey database.
